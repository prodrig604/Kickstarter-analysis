# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends in successful vs failed campaigns

##Overview of Project
###The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise, who is starting a project campaign, determine how she should organize her campaign based on data from other Theatre/Play campaigns. This data will help Louise decide how to manage her campaign and make it a successful one. 

##**Analysis and Challenges**: 
###My analysis of the data was conducted using different codes, formulas, and showing the results with pivot tables, value shading and line charts. I created a line chart to show outcomes of campaigns based on their launch date, which showed successful campaigns peaked during the months of May and June.

###The data also shows how the number and percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects based on their monetary goals. Campaigns that had a goal between of less than a $1000 had the most success, with a success rate of 76%.  
###Our analysis also shows that campaigns with a higher goal had a lower success rate and a higher failed rate

The data was also filtered to reflect how many backers different campaigns had, and the average donation each campaign received. This data was then filtered to only show the parent category “Theater”, and the subcategory “plays”. 
###Given the complexity of the analysis, there were some issues I ran into when calculating the percentages for successful, failed and canceled campaigns. After much trial and error, I realized I was using the wrong formula. Once I updated the formula, I was able to obtain the percentages for each outcome. I also had a difficult time with pivot tables, specifically knowing which information belongs in rows, columns, filters, and values. I discovered that the only way to solve this is to continue shuffling values around until you get the result you are looking for. I am hopeful that this will help me down the road.

##*Results*:
###What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
####Two conclusions I can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date are that the most successful outcomes were launched during the months of May and June, and that 	campaigns that were launched in December had the lowest number of successful campaigns.
###What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
####We can conclude that campaigns with a goal of less than $1000 saw the highest success, with a percentage rate of 76%. Additionally, the campaigns who had a higher set goal, 	from $45,000 to $49,999, had the lowest success rate with 0% and a failure rate of 100%.
###What are some limitations of this dataset?
####Some limitations of this dataset is that there isn’t a lot of information on why some campaigns were successful while others weren’t. If you review Failed US Kickstarters, you can see that some goals are not that far off from the campaigns that had the same goals but were successful, and the timeframe of these campaigns didn’t differ much from the successful ones. I would have liked to see what other factors may have contributed to the failure of these campaigns. 
###What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
####Another graph we could make could be a line chart that shows the outcome based on year of launch date. Other factors such as a pandemic, recession, war, etc. could also be a factor of failed campaigns. If we could show what year failed campaigns were higher, we can research further to see if there were any outside influences that could have also contributed to the campaigns’ failure.
